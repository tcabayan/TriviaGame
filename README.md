# TriviaGame
A trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. 

* Here, I have created a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.


* If the player selects the correct answer, a message on the screen will congratulate the player for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, tne next trivia question will be displayed without user input.


* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, the player will be alerted on the screen that its time is up and the correct answer will be displayed.    
Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will be alerted that they have selected the wrong option and then the correct answer will be displayed. After a few seconds, the next trivia question will show up on the screen. 

* On the final screen, the player will receive a summary of how many questions the player answered correctly, incorrectly, or left unanswered. An option to restart the game (without reloading the page) will be provided.
